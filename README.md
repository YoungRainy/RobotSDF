# RobotSDF
This is the code for the paper: RobotSDF: Implicit Morphology Modeling for the Robotic Arm

##
By setting the config parameter in reconstruct.py and running the reconstruct.py script, you can reconstruct the robotic arm model for any configuration. The reconstructed models are saved in the reconstruct_mesh directory.
